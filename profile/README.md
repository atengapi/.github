At the heart of AtenTEC technology stack is AtenGAPI, an ultra-optimized API engine designed for high-speed data processing, AI-driven query optimization, and seamless concurrency support. Unlike traditional API layers, AtenGAPI is not just a middleware—it is a powerful computational engine built to handle complex workflows in DAG structure, massive datasets, and high-frequency transactions with minimal resource consumption.

## Unmatched Performance

AtenGAPI is engineered for raw speed and efficiency, as demonstrated by its record-breaking benchmarks:

- 10 million row inserts in just 7 seconds (row size: 1KB, MySQL 8).
- 10 million row updates in 46 seconds, each row receiving a unique value.
- Hardware: First-gen Intel Core i5, 2GB RAM, Dockerized MySQL & AtenGAPI containers.

## Built-in AI Model

AtenGAPI incorporates an AI-driven query optimization engine, allowing it to intelligently manage and optimize SQL/NoSQL queries in real-time. This results in:

- Faster query execution with minimal overhead.
- Reduced database strain through smart caching and optimized indexing.
- Enhanced concurrency handling, ensuring seamless parallel processing of millions of transactions.

## Seamless Multi-Database Support

AtenGAPI is fully compatible with both SQL and NoSQL databases, making it a perfect choice for hybrid architectures. Whether it’s MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Google BigQuery, or any other data store, AtenGAPI ensures optimal performance with intelligent query transformations and efficient data handling.
